# üëã Hello!

I'm Chris Traganos, [@chris_trag](https://twitter.com/chris_trag) at work, or simply "Chris" works great too.

Welcome to my mini `about-me` page.

I assume you landed here by social media or meeting in real life. Either way, welcome and I hope we get the chance to connect.

## Who am I?

Currently, I'm leading ==Developer Evangelism== for Apps & Games at Amazon. It's an enormous organization where I have the opportunity to work alongside incredible developers from around the world as they build products on top of our app store, smart screens, and tablet devices.

Previously, I led Stripe‚Äôs Developer Advocacy program and launched Stripe's open source council, where we supported OSS projects within the developer community.

My focus is "Scaled Developer Relations," which is just a fancy way of saying that I'm focused on courting millions of developers to choose to build with our APIs and developer tools. During the pandemic, I wrote an article covering how we should approach DevRel differently: ["Welcome to the Golden Age of Developer Advocacy"](https://dev.to/stripe/welcome-to-the-golden-age-of-developer-advocacy-51fe).

Beyond work, I'm a father of 2 awesome kids and husband to an incredible partner. Over the past two decades, we've moved from Boston to SF and now Austin. It's been a fun adventure.

## What have I done?

I have the standard [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ctraganos) that lists these details, and here's a quick recap of a few teams I've had the privilege of working for (and some things I learned along the way):

### Stripe

The online payments platform for developers.

- **What I did**: Created the Developer Advocacy program, built the Developer Studios for video production, spun up the Community Experts program, hired a global team of engineers, and launched the React Native SDK.
- **What I learned**: The details matter, and doing your homework makes all the difference for projects.

### Mio

A tiny YC-backed startup based in Austin.

- **What I did**: Worked with hundreds of Slack 3rd-party developers to port their chat bots to Microsoft Teams. Eventually, I took on product & conversational UX as we pivoted into cross-platform chat.
- **What I learned**: Start-ups are hard, learn as much as you can, and small offices force you to work things out quickly.

### Roku

Streaming television platform that spun out of Netflix way back.

- **What I did**: Leading up to their IPO, I worked with a team of engineers, product managers, and developers to re-launch the Roku developer community and the developer website.
- **What I learned**: Unlike many SaaS startups, hardware products have a several-month production cycle that forces planned releases. In addition, keeping a user interface simple for the consumer was so valuable to see in action.

### Evernote

Note-taking app and open API for storing text, images, attachments, etc.

- **What I did**: Spent 4+ years launching and scaling the developer relations program along with organizing the annual developer conferences and accelerator program.
- **What I learned**: Companies are a complex series of interconnected relationships. Keeping an honest culture while rapidly growing is really hard and crucial for long-term survival.

### Harvard News Office

The central communications arm of Harvard University.

- **What I did**: I was a web developer for the digital comms team where I was maintaining Harvard.edu and re-launching the Harvard Gazette.
- **What I learned**: You can get many things unblocked and out the door once a majority of stakeholders across an organization see benefits to working together towards specific shared goals.

### Harvard Campus Services

The University's department for all things operations.

- **What I did**: Shuttle websites, environmental safety pages, dormitory pest control, etc. I started off as an intern and slowly worked my way into their full-time web developer role. I now know WAY too much about pests after having to manage these pages.
- **What I learned**: The power of mentorship and having a boss that is willing to teach and take a chance on you.

### Legal Sea Foods

Boston's top seafood restaurant and fresh Mail Order delivery business.

- **What I did**: Fun/crazy early-stage career path: Worked initially as a restaurant host then was asked to head over to restaurant HQ during the holiday season as they needed help packing live lobsters to ship across the US. Eventually, I jumped into a Customer Service role that eventually became an opportunity to work on their online newsletters, designing print coupons, and updating their online ordering website.
- **What I learned**: Show up, google/youtube everything, and work well with others. Also gained a healthy appreciation for quality New England Seafood.

## Let's connect

To start, the best way to reach out is over [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chris_trag) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ctraganos). If we already know each other, I'm always down for Marco Polo.

I'm open to speaking at conferences, providing app / UX feedback, reviewing developer documentation / dogfooding, sketching, resume reviews, and providing advice/introductions (if/when appropriate!)

If you'd like my assistance, it would help to make your request clear and provide the details in advance of a conversation (Half the challenge is scheduling and making sure I could be useful, tbh)
