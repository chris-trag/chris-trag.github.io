# 👋 Hello! I'm Chris Traganos
Welcome to my placeholder page 🎉 

I assume you've landed on this site either by social media or meeting in real life. Either way, welcome and I hope we get the chance to connect.

## 🤔 Who am I?
Currently I'm working on the Developer Relations team at Stripe. It's a pretty sweet gig where I get to interact with incredible developers from around the world while they build amazing products using Stripe's payment APIs and services. 

At work, I'm focused on `"Scaled Developer Advocacy"`, which is really just a fancy way of saying that I am planning for millions more developers to choose Stripe as their favorite payment platform. Practically, this means I'm working on getting new programs launched; everything from developer live-streaming to growing the collection of 3rd party apps in our [partner gallery](https://stripe.com/partners).

Beyond work, I'm a father of 2 awesome kids and husband to an incredible partner. We've moved from Boston to SF and now Austin over the past 2 decades together.

## 🗺 Locations

I'm currently splitting my time between Austin and San Francisco. I moved to Austin about 3 years ago with my family and love it so far. *Reach out if you are curious about moving here!*

Typically I'm working from Stripe HQ and/or Stripe Seattle one week a month. Our team is very distributed and those in-person planning sessions are the best. The the rest of the month I can be found around the multiple WeWork locations in and around downtown Austin.

Previously I lived in:
* Sunnyvale, CA
* Arlington, MA 
* Lexington, MA 
* Woburn, MA 


## 🧳 What have I done?

I have the standard [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ctraganos) that lists these details, but here's a quick recap of a few teams I've had the privilege of working for and some things I learned along the way.

* **[Mio](https://m.io)** - A tiny YC-backed startup based in Austin.  
   * **What I did:** Worked with hundreds of Slack 3rd-party developers hoping to port their chat bots to Microsoft Teams. Eventually, I took on product & conversational UX as we pivoted into cross-platform chat. 
    * **What I learned:** Start-ups are *hard*, learn as much as you can, and small offices force you work things out quickly.
* **[Roku](https://developer.roku.com)** - Streaming television platform that spun out of Netflix *way* back.
  * **What I did:** Leading up to their IPO, I worked with a team of engineers, product managers, and developers to re-launch the Roku developer community and the developer website.
  * **What I learned:** Unlike many SaaS startups, hardware products have a several month production cycle that forces planned releases. Also keeping a user interface simple for the consumer was valuable to see in action.
* **[Evernote](http://dev.evernote.com)** - Note-taking app and open API for storing text, images, attachments, etc.
   * **What I did:** Spent 4+ years launching and scaling the developer relations program along with organizing the [annual developer conferences](https://evernotedevcup.devpost.com/updates/472-join-us-at-the-evernote-trunk-conference) and [accelerator program](https://dev.evernote.com/accelerator/). 
    * **What I learned:** Companies are simply a complex series of interconnected relationships. Keeping an honest culture while rapidly growing is really hard and crucial for long-term survival.
* **[Harvard News Office](https://hpac.harvard.edu/)** - The central communications arm of Harvard University.
    * **What I did:** I was a web developer for the digital communications team, working on maintaining Harvard.edu and re-launching the [Harvard Gazette](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/). 
    * **What I learned:** You can get many things unblocked and out the door once *multiple* stakeholders across an organization see clear benefits to working together towards specific goals.
* **[Harvard Campus Services](https://www.ehs.harvard.edu/)** - The University's department for all things operations.
    * **What I did:** Shuttle websites, environmental safety pages, dormitory pest control, etc. I started off as an intern and slowly worked my way into their full-time web developer role. I now know WAY too much about pests after having to manage [these pages 🦟🕷🐞](https://www.ehs.harvard.edu/programs/pest-control)
    * **What I learned:** The power of mentorship and having a boss that is willing to [teach and take a chance on you](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-hire-ming-chow/).
* **[Legal Sea Foods](https://shop.legalseafoods.com/)** - Boston's top seafood restaurant and fresh Mail Order delivery business
    * **What I did:** Fun/crazy early-stage career path: Worked initially as a restaurant host then was asked to head over to restaurant HQ during the holiday season as they needed help packing *live lobsters* to ship across the US 🦞📦. Eventually I jumped into a Customer Service role that in-turn became an opportunity to work on their online newsletters, designing print coupons, and updating their onnline ordering website.
    * **What I learned:** Show up, google/youtube everything, and work well with others. Also gained a healthy appreciation for quality New England Seafood.

## 🤝 Let's connect

To start, the best way to reach out is over [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ctraganos) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ctraganos/).

I'm open to speaking at conferences, providing app / UX feedback, reviewing developer documentation, resume reviews, and providing introductions (*if appropriate!*) 

If you'd like my assistance, it would help to make your request clear and provide the details in advance of a conversation 👍 
*(Half the challenge is scheduling and making sure I'm able to be useful, tbh)*
