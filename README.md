# 👋 Hello! Welcome to my website
You've landed on my contact page either by social media or meeting in real life.

## Who am I?
Currently I'm working at Stripe, where I'm focused on scaling developer advocacy. Previously I worked at a few places and learned some things along the way.

* **[Mio](https://m.io)** - A tiny startup based in Austin, I started off working with hundreds of Slack 3rd-party developers looking to launch their chat apps on Microsoft Teams. Eventually, I took on product & conversational UX as we pivoted into cross-platform chat. 
* **[Roku](https://developer.roku.com)** - Leading up to their IPO, I worked with a team of engineers, product managers, and developers to re-launch the Roku developer community and the developer website. 
* **[Evernote](http://dev.evernote.com)** - Spent a little over 4 years launching and scaling the developer relations program along with organizing the [annual developer conferences](https://evernotedevcup.devpost.com/updates/472-join-us-at-the-evernote-trunk-conference) and [accelerator program](https://dev.evernote.com/accelerator/). 
* **[Harvard News Office](https://hpac.harvard.edu/)** - I was a web developer for the digital comms team, working on Harvard.edu and the [Harvard Gazette](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/). 
* **[Harvard Campus Services](https://www.ehs.harvard.edu/)** - Shuttle websites, environmental safety pages, dormitory pest control, etc. I started off as an intern and slowly worked my way into their web developer role. I now know WAY too much about pests after having to manage [these pages 🦟🕷🐞](https://www.ehs.harvard.edu/programs/pest-control) 
* **[Legal Sea Foods](https://shop.legalseafoods.com/)** Fun/crazy path: Worked initially as a restaurant host then got the chance to work up at the HQ during the holiday season because they needed help packing live lobsters to ship across the US 🦞📦. Eventually I jumped into a Customer Service role that in turn became an opportunity to work on their online newsletters, design print coupons, and update their ordering website.

# 🗺Locations

I'm currently splitting my time between Austin and San Francisco. I moved to Austin about 3 years ago and love it so far. *Reach out if you are curious about moving here!*

Typically I'm working out of Stripe HQ one week a month. Our team is very distributed and those in-person planning sessions are the best.

Previously I lived in:
* Sunnyvale, CA
* Arlington, MA 
* Lexington, MA 
* Woburn, MA
