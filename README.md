# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to my website
You've landed on my contact page either by social media or meeting in real life.

## Who am I?
Currently I'm working at Stripe, where I'm focused on scaling developer advocacy. Previously I worked at a few places and learned some things along the way.

* Mio - A tiny startup based in Austin, I ran the product side of the business along with getting our initial pilot customers up and running. 
* Roku - Leading up to their IPO, I re-launched the Roku developer community and their developer website. 
* Evernote - Spent a little over 4 years launching their developer relations program along with organizing the developer tracks and accelerator program. 
* Harvard News Office - I was a web developer for the digital comms team, working on Harvard.edu and the Harvard Gazette. I learned *a lot* there and it was one of the hardest yet best experiences.
* Harvard Campus Services - Shuttle websites, environmental safety pages, dormitory pest control, etc. I started off as an intern and slowly built a lot of pages

# ðŸ—ºLocations

I'm currently splitting my time between Austin and San Francisco. I moved to Austin about 3 years ago and love it so far. *Reach out if you are curious about moving here!*

Typically I'm working out of Stripe HQ one week a month. Our team is very distributed and those in-person planning sessions are the best.

Previously I lived in:
* Sunnyvale, CA
* Arlington, MA 
* Lexington, MA 
* Woburn, MA
