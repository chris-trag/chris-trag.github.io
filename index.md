# 👋 Hello! 

### I'm Chris Traganos / [@chris_trag](https://twitter.com/chris_trag) / "Trag" at work / or simply "Chris" works great too. 🙌

Welcome to my mini `about-me` page 🎉 

I assume you landed here by social media or meeting in real life. Either way, welcome and I hope we get the chance to connect.

## 🤔 Who am I?
Currently I'm leading the Developer Advocacy team at [Stripe](https://stripe.com). It's an amazing place where I get to work alongside incredible developers and founders from around the world as they build products on top of our [payment APIs](https://stripe.com/docs) and [infrastructure services](https://stripe.com/about). In addition to Developer Advocacy, I co-lead Stripe's Open Source council, where we work to best support OSS contributors at Stripe and within the developer community.

My focus is _"Scaled Developer Advocacy"_, which is just a fancy way of saying that I'm focused on courting millions developers to choose Stripe as their favorite payments platform. Most days I'm working to launch new outreach programs, [evangelising our API updates](https://dev.to/stripe), and growing the collection of technical workshops on our [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/stripedevelopers). In addition, I wrote an article covering how we approach work: "[Welcome to the Golden Age of Developer Advocacy](https://dev.to/stripe/welcome-to-the-golden-age-of-developer-advocacy-51fe)".

Beyond work, I'm a father of 2 awesome kids and husband to an incredible partner. Over the past two decades we've moved from Boston to SF and now Austin. It's been a fun adventure.

## 🗺 Locations

I'm currently splitting my time between Austin (primary), Seattle, and San Francisco. I moved to Austin a few years ago with my family and love it so far. *Reach out if you are curious about moving to ATX!*

When travelling I'm usually working from Stripe HQ and/or the Seattle office every 6-8 weeks. [Our team](https://twitter.com/stripedev) is globally distributed and the in-person planning sessions are the best. The majority of any given month I can be found in and around downtown Austin.

**Some places I've lived:**
* Austin, TX
* Sunnyvale, CA
* Arlington, MA 
* Lexington, MA 
* Woburn, MA 


## 🧳 What have I done?

I have the standard [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ctraganos) that lists these details and here's a quick recap of a few teams I've had the privilege of working for _(and some things I learned along the way!)_

#### [💬 Mio](https://m.io)
A tiny YC-backed startup based in Austin.  

   * **What I did:** Worked with hundreds of [Slack](http://slack.com) 3rd-party developers to port their chat bots to Microsoft Teams. Eventually, I took on product & conversational UX as we pivoted into cross-platform chat. 
    * **What I learned:** Start-ups are *hard*, learn as much as you can, and small offices force you work things out quickly.

#### [📺 Roku](https://developer.roku.com)
Streaming television platform that spun out of Netflix *way* back.

  * **What I did:** Leading up to their IPO, I worked with a team of engineers, product managers, and developers to re-launch the Roku developer community and the developer website.
  * **What I learned:** Unlike many SaaS startups, hardware products have a several month production cycle that forces planned releases. In addition, keeping a user interface simple for the consumer was so valuable to see in action.

#### [🐘 Evernote](http://dev.evernote.com)
Note-taking app and open API for storing text, images, attachments, etc.

   * **What I did:** Spent 4+ years launching and scaling the developer relations program along with organizing the [annual developer conferences](https://evernotedevcup.devpost.com/updates/472-join-us-at-the-evernote-trunk-conference) and [accelerator program](https://dev.evernote.com/accelerator/). 
    * **What I learned:** Companies are a complex series of interconnected relationships. Keeping an honest culture while rapidly growing is really hard and crucial for long-term survival.

#### [🎓 Harvard News Office](https://hpac.harvard.edu/)
The central communications arm of Harvard University.
    
   * **What I did:** I was a web developer for the digital comms team where I was maintaining Harvard.edu and re-launching the [Harvard Gazette](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/). 
   * **What I learned:** You can get many things unblocked and out the door once *a majority of* stakeholders across an organization see benefits to working together towards specific shared goals.

#### [🏭 Harvard Campus Services](https://www.ehs.harvard.edu/)
The University's department for all things operations.

   * **What I did:** Shuttle websites, environmental safety pages, dormitory pest control, etc. I started off as an intern and slowly worked my way into their full-time web developer role. I now know WAY too much about pests after having to manage [these pages 🦟🕷🐞](https://www.ehs.harvard.edu/programs/pest-control)
   * **What I learned:** The power of mentorship and having a boss that is willing to [teach and take a chance on you](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-hire-ming-chow/).

#### [🐟 Legal Sea Foods](https://shop.legalseafoods.com/)
Boston's top seafood restaurant and fresh Mail Order delivery business

  * **What I did:** Fun/crazy early-stage career path: Worked initially as a restaurant host then was asked to head over to restaurant HQ during the holiday season as they needed help packing *live lobsters* to ship across the US 🦞📦. Eventually I jumped into a Customer Service role that eventually became an opportunity to work on their online newsletters, designing print coupons, and updating their online ordering website.
   * **What I learned:** Show up, google/youtube everything, and work well with others. Also gained a healthy appreciation for quality New England Seafood.

## 🤝 Let's connect

To start, the best way to reach out is over [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ctraganos) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ctraganos/). If we already know each other, I'm always down for [🍭Marco Polo](https://marcopolo.me/s/chris-t-EwXsv). 


I'm open to speaking at conferences, providing app / UX feedback, reviewing developer documentation / dogfooding, [sketching](https://www.instagram.com/trag.sketch/), resume reviews, and providing advice/introductions (*if/when appropriate!*) 

If you'd like my assistance, it would help to make your request clear and provide the details in advance of a conversation 👍 
*(Half the challenge is scheduling and making sure I could be useful, tbh)*
