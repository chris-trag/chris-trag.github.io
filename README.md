# üëã Hello! I'm Chris Traganos
Welcome to my placeholder page that I keep telling myself will be a real website someday. I assume you've landed on this site either by social media or meeting in real life. Either way, welcome and I hope we get the chance to connect.

## ü§î Who am I?
Currently I'm working on the Developer Relations team at Stripe. It's a pretty sweet gig where I get to interact with incredible developers from around the world while they build amazing products using Stripe's payment APIs and services. 

Currently, I'm focused on `"Scaled Developer Advocacy"`, which is really just a fancy way of saying that I *really* want millions more developers choosing Stripe as their favorite payment platform. I'm testing programs from beta developer access, virtual workshops, and certified dev programs.




## What have I done?

I have the standard [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ctraganos) that lists these details, but here's a quick recap of a few teams I've had the privilege of working for and some things I learned along the way.

* **[Mio](https://m.io)** - A tiny YC-backed startup based in Austin.  
   * **What I did:** Worked with hundreds of Slack 3rd-party developers wanting to launch their chat bots on Microsoft Teams. Eventually, I took on product & conversational UX as we pivoted into cross-platform chat. 
    * **What I learned:** Start-ups are *hard*, learn as much as you can, and small offices help you work things out quickly.
* **[Roku](https://developer.roku.com)** - Strat
  * **What I did:** Leading up to their IPO, I worked with a team of engineers, product managers, and developers to re-launch the Roku developer community and the developer website.
  * **What I learned:** Hardware has a several month production cycle that forces planned releases, unlike many SaaS startups. Also keeping a product simple so that it gets out of the consumer's way was so valuable to see in action.
* **[Evernote](http://dev.evernote.com)** - Spent a little over 4 years launching and scaling the developer relations program along with organizing the [annual developer conferences](https://evernotedevcup.devpost.com/updates/472-join-us-at-the-evernote-trunk-conference) and [accelerator program](https://dev.evernote.com/accelerator/). 
* **[Harvard News Office](https://hpac.harvard.edu/)** - I was a web developer for the digital comms team, working on Harvard.edu and the [Harvard Gazette](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/). 
* **[Harvard Campus Services](https://www.ehs.harvard.edu/)** - Shuttle websites, environmental safety pages, dormitory pest control, etc. I started off as an intern and slowly worked my way into their web developer role. I now know WAY too much about pests after having to manage [these pages ü¶üüï∑üêû](https://www.ehs.harvard.edu/programs/pest-control) 
* **[Legal Sea Foods](https://shop.legalseafoods.com/)** Fun/crazy path: Worked initially as a restaurant host then got the chance to work up at the HQ during the holiday season because they needed help packing live lobsters to ship across the US ü¶ûüì¶. Eventually I jumped into a Customer Service role that in turn became an opportunity to work on their online newsletters, design print coupons, and update their ordering website.

# üó∫Locations

I'm currently splitting my time between Austin and San Francisco. I moved to Austin about 3 years ago and love it so far. *Reach out if you are curious about moving here!*

Typically I'm working out of Stripe HQ one week a month. Our team is very distributed and those in-person planning sessions are the best.

Previously I lived in:
* Sunnyvale, CA
* Arlington, MA 
* Lexington, MA 
* Woburn, MA
