# üëã Hello!

I‚Äôm Chris / ‚ÄúTrag‚Äù.

Currently, I lead Developer Evangelism for [Alexa+](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa), [Apps, & Games](https://developer.amazon.com/apps-and-games) at ==[Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/). It‚Äôs an enormous developer program where I get to work with a global community of builders and partners creating products using our [LLM-powered AI SDKs](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2025/02/new-alexa-announce-blog), [streaming media players](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Family/b?ie=UTF8&node=8521791011), and [app categories](https://www.amazon.com/mobile-apps/b?nodl=1&ie=UTF8&node=2350149011).
 
Previously, I served as the Head of Developer Advocacy at Stripe where I led an amazing team of engineers, TPMs, and community managers. Together we launched Stripe‚Äôs [Open Source council](https://github.com/customer-stories/stripe) and built the collection of [@StripeDev](https://twitter.com/StripeDev) scaled channels for [sample code](https://github.com/stripe-samples), [video](https://www.youtube.com/stripedevelopers), and [dev articles](https://stripe.dev/). I‚Äôm particularly proud of shedding light on the art of ==[‚ÄúFriction Logs‚Äù](https://x.com/lennysan/status/1658293670960066562?lang=en)==: both [how](https://mikebifulco.com/posts/how-stripe-uses-friction-logs) to create them and why it‚Äôs critical for _everyone_ to dogfood what we‚Äôre building. 

I built Developer Relations programs at [Evernote](https://dev.evernote.com/) (Pre-acquisition), [Honda](https://xcelerator.hondainnovations.com/honda-silicon-valley-lab-launches-hsvl-vehicle-api-for-evernote-devcup/), and [Roku](https://developer.roku.com/) (Pre-IPO). In addition, I was the VP of Product at [M.io](https://m.io) (YC‚Äô16), co-created the [Evernote Pebble Watch app](https://appleinsider.com/articles/14/03/07/pebble_adds_ebay_evernote_time_warner_as_latest_smart_watch_app_partners.html), and was the [lead web developer](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/06/for-harvard-an-it-summit/) for the Harvard News Office.

I was raised in Boston and came of age during the [browser wars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughts_on_Flash) & [flash battles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughts_on_Flash) of the early aughts before moving to the San Francisco Bay. I fell in love with full-stack development thanks to [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/about/), the [Minuteman HS WebDev program](https://www.minuteman.org/career-technical-education/majors/programming-and-web-development), the [Markup & Style Society](https://www.flickr.com/groups/markupandstyle/pool/) / [Dribbble](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbble) meetups, and co-organizing [WordCamp Boston](https://boston.wordcamp.org/2011/call-for-volunteers/). 

Currently, I split my time between Austin (primary) and Seattle (HQ).
